**Update v2.11.2**

- Render Controllers are now standardized in which only pokemon that need custom render controllers (skin mapping) will get one.
  This reduces pack size, and makes editing of the basic file a lot easier.
- Added missing Zorua halloween dark sprite
- File Logging has been removed for scripts to prevent useless info.
- Now when generating entity files, the item textures file is now only edited once, to prevent broken reading and increase build speed.
- Fixed HUGE problem with compression on images, that resulted in broken texture displays of pokemon.
- Added Spanish + German v2.11.1 Halloween and Badges Translations by @TheBlueJo
